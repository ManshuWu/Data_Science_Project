{"text": "Mutations in nuclear-encoded genes that are involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance (e.g., POLG) have been associated with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) phenotype. These nuclear genome mutations may lead to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions or mitochondrial DNA depletion. On the other hand, primary genetic defects of mitochondrial DNA (such as single large-scale deletion or point mutations) have also been associated with the CPEO phenotype. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) may be a manifestation of specific syndromes that, when clinically recognized, prompt clinicians to investigate specific genetic defects. Thus, CPEO, as part of Kearns Sayre syndrome, suggests the presence of a large-scale deletion of mitochondrial DNA. However, in pure CPEO or CPEO plus phenotypes, it is more difficult to know whether causative genetic defects affect the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. Here, we present a patient with a long-standing history of CPEO plus phenotype, in whom the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from skeletal muscle was normal, and no other genetic defect was suspected at first. At the time of our evaluation, the presence of polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain prompted us to investigate nuclear genetic defects and, specifically, mutations in the POLG gene. Thus, the sequencing of the POLG gene revealed p.Thr251Ile and p.Pro587Leu mutations in one allele, and p.Ala467Thr mutation in another allele. Although one would expect that mutations in POLG lead to multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions or depletion (loss of copies), the absence of mitochondrial DNA abnormalities in tissue may be explained by heteroplasmy, a lack or no significant involvement of biopsied tissue, or a sampling bias. So, the absence of secondary mitochondrial DNA alterations should not discourage clinicians from further investigating mutations in nuclear-encoded genes. Lastly, mitochondrial point mutations and single mitochondrial DNA deletions very rarely cause CPEO associated with polyneuropathy and neuropathic pain, and POLG-related disease should be considered in this scenario, instead.", "spans": [{"start": 964, "end": 971, "label": "PATIENT"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1008, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 1201, "end": 1215, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1236, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 1324, "end": 1328, "label": "GENE"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1367, "label": "GENE"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1393, "label": "GENE_VARIANT"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1409, "label": "GENE_VARIANT"}, {"start": 1439, "end": 1450, "label": "GENE_VARIANT"}]}

We suspected that the normal result of mtDNA sequencing from biopsied muscle and the nonspecific and mild pathological findings contributed to delay in diagnosis in this case. However, although sequencing of mtDNA may identify deletions and point mutations, it may miss mtDNA depletion (loss of mtDNA copies) that would require assessment of copy number which was not performed. It is also plausible that skeletal muscle was not affected enough to reveal abnormalities of mtDNA (low or no mutant copies of mtDNA to detect), or that muscle sampling missed mtDNA abnormalities, or a combination of both.

{"text": "Combined morphological, immunocytochemical, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on skeletal muscle, heart muscle and liver tissue of a 16-months boy with fatal liver failure. The pathological characterization of the tissues revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) that was most pronounced in liver, followed by a less severe, but still significant depletion in skeletal muscle and the heart. The primary cause of the disease was linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the polymerase 'Y (POLG) gene (DNA polymerase 'Y; A467T, K1191N). We present evidence, that compound heterozygous POLG mutations lead to tissue selective impairment of mtDNA replication and thus to a mosaic defect pattern even in the severely affected liver. A variable defect pattern was found in liver, muscle and heart tissue as revealed by biochemical, cytochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analysis. Functionally, a severe deficiency of cytochrome-c-oxidase (cox) activity was seen in the liver. Although mtDNA depletion was detected in heart and skeletal muscle, there was no cox deficiency in these tissues. Depletion of mtDNA and microdissection of coxpositive or negative areas correlated with the histological pattern in the liver. Interestingly, the mosaic pattern detected for cox-activity and mtDNA copy number fully aligned with the immunohistologically revealed defect pattern using Pol 'Y, mtSSBand mtTFA-antibodies, thus substantiating the hypothesis that nuclear encoded proteins located within mitochondria become unstable and are degraded when they are not actively bound to mtDNA.

{"text": "Combined morphological, immunocytochemical, biochemical and molecular genetic studies were performed on skeletal muscle, heart muscle and liver tissue of a 16-months boy with fatal liver failure. The pathological characterization of the tissues revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) that was most pronounced in liver, followed by a less severe, but still significant depletion in skeletal muscle and the heart. The primary cause of the disease was linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the polymerase 'Y (POLG) gene (DNA polymerase 'Y; A467T, K1191N). We present evidence, that compound heterozygous POLG mutations lead to tissue selective impairment of mtDNA replication and thus to a mosaic defect pattern even in the severely affected liver. A variable defect pattern was found in liver, muscle and heart tissue as revealed by biochemical, cytochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analysis. Functionally, a severe deficiency of cytochrome-c-oxidase (cox) activity was seen in the liver. Although mtDNA depletion was detected in heart and skeletal muscle, there was no cox deficiency in these tissues. Depletion of mtDNA and microdissection of coxpositive or negative areas correlated with the histological pattern in the liver. Interestingly, the mosaic pattern detected for cox-activity and mtDNA copy number fully aligned with the immunohistologically revealed defect pattern using Pol 'Y, mtSSBand mtTFA-antibodies, thus substantiating the hypothesis that nuclear encoded proteins located within mitochondria become unstable and are degraded when they are not actively bound to mtDNA.

{"text": "The catalytic subunit plays a critical role since it contains both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities (Longley et al., 2001). Mutations in POLG represent the most common causes of autosomally inherited mitochondrial diseases in children and adults (Wong et al., 2008). The ﬁrst mutation in POLG was discovered in 2001 in a Belgian family with Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (PEO) (Van Goethem et al., 2001). The phenotype of patients with POLG mutations is often heterogeneous and, as observed in other mitochondrial disorders, may lead to involvement of several organ systems. The reported POLG mutations are inherited either in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner (DiMauro et al., 2006; Horvath et al., 2006). Diagnosis in a clinical setting may pose a challenge to clinicians and molecular testing including sequencing of POLG in suspected cases can help to reach a diagnosis and institute proper counseling. In this report we present an adult patient with a complicated medical history where multiple evaluations had failed to arrive at a diagnosis until a novel POLG mutation, brieﬂy described in an earlier paper by Tang et al.

Because the clinical picture can be quite miscellaneous, it is challenging to assort patients to any of the currently described syndromes; therefore, to provide such a patient with a conclusive diagnosis can be challenging for the neurologist. A typical magnetic resonance imaging finding is probably the most useful landmark in the diagnostic process, which will steer the clinician toward POLG gene testing. To illustrate this, we present a case of progressive ataxia caused by A467T and W748S mutations of POLG gene, who presented with overlapping symptoms of autosomal recessive mitochondrial ataxic syndrome and SANDO, as well as choreoathetotic movements and dysphonia.

Prognosis of mitochondrial epilepsy is often poor and there are few reports of successful treatment of POLG-related epilepsy. We describe a 26-year-old woman who experienced severe headache during a three-day period, followed by symptoms of visual ﬂashing, speech difﬁculty, and generalised seizures. EEG recording showed non-convulsive status epilepticus (left occipital area) and brain MRI revealed parieto-occipital T2-hyperintensities. Visual aura and aphasia persisted despite antiepileptic medication with phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. Mitochondrial disorder was clinically suspected and a homozygous c.2243G>C mutation (p.Trp748Ser) was discovered in the POLG1 gene. The patient was then set on a low glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) variant of the ketogenic diet, after which the headaches, aphasia, and visual aura progressively improved and disappeared. She returned home two weeks after onset of symptoms and has not had further seizures. She continues to receive levetiracetam monotherapy and LGIT.

Deep tendon reflexes, as well as strength, bulk and tone were normal. Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements and rapid alternating movements were normal. A MRI of the brain at age 52 was normal. At age 57, neuro-ophthalmic evaluation revealed a mild supranuclear vertical gaze paresis and a mild right internuclear ophthalmoparesis (slowed right adducting saccades with dissociated abducting nystagmus) localizing to the rostral midbrain (Liu, et al.). There was no gazeevoked nystagmus, saccadic dysmetria, or abnormal lack of suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex, and her optic nerves were normal in appearance. Nerve conductions of the left arm (Table 1) revealed mildly reduced sensory amplitudes and normal to reduced motor responses in the feet; electromyography of the left leg showed moderate, chronic denervation in distal muscles.

In this work we have studied the functional consequence of POLγ A mutations in a patient with an uncommon and a very severe disease phenotype characterized by prenatal onset with intrauterine growth restriction, lactic acidosis from birth, encephalopathy, hepatopathy, myopathy, and early death. Muscle biopsy identified scattered COX-deficient muscle fibers, respiratory chain dysfunction and mtDNA depletion. We identified a novel POLγ A mutation (p.His1134Tyr) in trans with the previously identified p.Thr251Ile/Pro587Leu double mutant. Biochemical characterization of the purified recombinant POLγ A variants showed that the p.His1134Tyr mutation caused severe polymerase dysfunction.

Postprandial lactate was normal. In contrast, hypoglycemia and hyperlactacidemia were induced by fasting periods of 8 h and did not respond to IM glucagon. LCT restriction induced a decreased of abdominal distension and jaundice, associated with biochemical improvement of hepatocellular cytolysis and cholestasis.

She had an intermittent tremor, moderate truncal ataxia with a wide-based gait. Between 4 and 49/12 years of age, she suffered 2 more episodes of status epilepticus requiring artificial ventilation and was treated with different anti-epileptic drugs except valproate.

In LCHAD deficiency, liver cirrhotic changes are presumed to be a toxic effect of the accumulating 3-hydroxy fatty acids.15 In the same way, in children harbouring POLG mutations, valproic acid which is a branched chain carboxylic acid has been reported as very hepatotoxic in AS.16 In some of the MDDS patients, an elevation of AFP levels can be a helpful diagnostic clue. In the present patient, AFP levels were initially markedly increased and subsequently returned to lower values (35.2 ng/ ml; normal: 0e15.0 ng/ml).

{"text": "Abstract: Autosomal recessive ataxias caused by mutations of the polymerase g (POLG) gene make an important group of progressive ataxias accompanied by a diverse spectrum of neurological disorders. Because the clinical picture can be quite miscellaneous, it is challenging to assort patients to any of the currently described syndromes; therefore, to provide such a patient with a conclusive diagnosis can be challenging for the neurologist. A typical magnetic resonance imaging finding is probably the most useful landmark in the diagnostic process, which will steer the clinician toward POLG gene testing. To illustrate this, we present a case of progressive ataxia caused by A467T and W748S mutations of POLG gene, who presented with overlapping symptoms of autosomal recessive mitochondrial ataxic syndrome and SANDO, as well as choreoathetotic movements and dysphonia. After lengthy investigations, magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities in the thalamus, inferior olives, and cerebellum, which led us to the analysis of POLG mutations.", "spans": [{"start": 641, "end": 645, "token_start": 107, "token_end": 107, "label": "PATIENT"}, {"start": 649, "end": 667, "token_start": 109, "token_end": 110, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 678, "end": 683, "token_start": 113, "token_end": 114, "label": "GENE_VARIANT"}, {"start": 688, "end": 693, "token_start": 116, "token_end": 116, "label": "GENE_VARIANT"}, {"start": 707, "end": 711, "token_start": 119, "token_end": 119, "label": "GENE"}, {"start": 833, "end": 848, "token_start": 139, "token_end": 139, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 863, "end": 872, "token_start": 142, "token_end": 142, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 951, "end": 983, "token_start": 155, "token_end": 158, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 985, "end": 1000, "token_start": 160, "token_end": 161, "label": "HPO_TERM"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1016, "token_start": 164, "token_end": 164, "label": "HPO_TERM"}]}

EEG recording showed non-convulsive status epilepticus (left occipital area) and brain MRI revealed parieto-occipital T2-hyperintensities. Visual aura and aphasia persisted despite antiepileptic medication with phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. Mitochondrial disorder was clinically suspected and a homozygous c.2243G>C mutation (p.Trp748Ser) was discovered in the POLG1 gene. The patient was then set on a low glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) variant of the ketogenic diet, after which the headaches, aphasia, and visual aura progressively improved and disappeared. She returned home two weeks after onset of symptoms and has not had further seizures. She continues to receive levetiracetam monotherapy and LGIT.

Liver biopsy revealed early cirrhosis, steatosis, and focal necrosis. Muscle biopsy did not demonstrate speciﬁc abnormalities of mitochondrial morphology or number.

{"text": "Mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction can cause a variety of diseases known as mitochondrial disorders. Polymerase γ (POLG) is the enzyme responsible for the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Pol γA, the catalytic core of the enzyme, is encoded by the nuclear POLG1 gene. Mutations of this gene are associated with multiple deletions and/or depletion of mtDNA, which may lead to impaired energy production in the mitochondria and the so-called POLG syndromes [1]. Since the discovery of the gene in 1996, more than 100 pathogenic mutations have been linked to a wide range of nonneurological and neurological disorders. Among the neurological manifestations, there is an overlapping phenotypic spectrum that may include myopathy, neuropathy, ptosis, epilepsy, muscle pain, ataxia and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Although rare, cases of parkinsonism have also been described in association with POLG1 mutations.

Neuropsychological tests revealed cognitive impairment with executive dysfunction, language domain impairment and mild apraxia. Serum analyses showed a total CK activity of 92 U/l (normal ≤ 169). Other serum parameters, including the levels of pyruvate, copper, ceruloplasmin, folic acid, vitamin B12 and thyroid hormones, were normal. A brain MRI scan revealed moderate enlargement of the ventricles and diffuse brain atrophy. Bilateral striatal dopamine deﬁciency, which was most marked in the left putamen, was evidenced by N-ﬂuoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-4-[123I]iodophenyltropane SPECT. The patient was initiated on levodopa/carbidopa (300/75 mg per day), to which she exhibited a partial response (mild reduction in bradykinesia and rigidity). Electromyography and nerve conduction studies showed no abnormalities, and echocardiography revealed no signiﬁcant disturbances. A mitochondrial disorder was suspected, and a muscle biopsy of the biceps brachii demonstrated ragged red ﬁbres based on Gomori staining (Fig. 1). Southern blot hybridization analysis identiﬁed multiple mtDNA deletions that were conﬁrmed using the long-PCR technique. Given this ﬁnding, the POLG1 gene was sequenced by the standard Sanger method.

The pathological characterization of the tissues revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) that was most pronounced in liver, followed by a less severe, but still significant depletion in skeletal muscle and the heart. The primary cause of the disease was linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the polymerase 'Y (POLG) gene (DNA polymerase 'Y; A467T, K1191N). We present evidence, that compound heterozygous POLG mutations lead to tissue selective impairment of mtDNA replication and thus to a mosaic defect pattern even in the severely affected liver. A variable defect pattern was found in liver, muscle and heart tissue as revealed by biochemical, cytochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analysis. Functionally, a severe deficiency of cytochrome-c-oxidase (cox) activity was seen in the liver. Although mtDNA depletion was detected in heart and skeletal muscle, there was no cox deficiency in these tissues. Depletion of mtDNA and microdissection of coxpositive or negative areas correlated with the histological pattern in the liver. Interestingly, the mosaic pattern detected for cox-activity and mtDNA copy number fully aligned with the immunohistologically revealed defect pattern using Pol 'Y, mtSSBand mtTFA-antibodies, thus substantiating the hypothesis that nuclear encoded proteins located within mitochondria become unstable and are degraded when they are not actively bound to mtDNA.

{"text": "The catalytic subunit plays a critical role since it contains both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities (Longley et al., 2001). Mutations in POLG represent the most common causes of autosomally inherited mitochondrial diseases in children and adults (Wong et al., 2008). The ﬁrst mutation in POLG was discovered in 2001 in a Belgian family with Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (PEO) (Van Goethem et al., 2001). The phenotype of patients with POLG mutations is often heterogeneous and, as observed in other mitochondrial disorders, may lead to involvement of several organ systems. The reported POLG mutations are inherited either in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner (DiMauro et al., 2006; Horvath et al., 2006). Diagnosis in a clinical setting may pose a challenge to clinicians and molecular testing including sequencing of POLG in suspected cases can help to reach a diagnosis and institute proper counseling. In this report we present an adult patient with a complicated medical history where multiple evaluations had failed to arrive at a diagnosis until a novel POLG mutation, brieﬂy described in an earlier paper by Tang et al.
