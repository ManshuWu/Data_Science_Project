It may be speculative if the more generalized and severe signal abnormalities in our patient are consequences of the natural history of the disorder itself or due to the characteristic complications of the disease like refractory status epilepticus. Involvement of the deep grey internal nuclei, however, is not consistent with prolonged status epilepticus. Therefore, these ﬁndings can be interpreted as an expression of the terminal phase of encephalopathy in this distinct mitochondrial disorder. Differential diagnostically, pronounced thalamic signal changes in MRI can be present in general cerebral hypoxia, the variant of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, deep cerebral vein thrombosis, and various mitochondrial disorders like infantile Leigh syndrome or Kearns-Sayre syndrome.

The pathological characterization of the tissues revealed a severe depletion of mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) that was most pronounced in liver, followed by a less severe, but still significant depletion in skeletal muscle and the heart. The primary cause of the disease was linked to compound heterozygous mutations in the polymerase 'Y (POLG) gene (DNA polymerase 'Y; A467T, K1191N). We present evidence, that compound heterozygous POLG mutations lead to tissue selective impairment of mtDNA replication and thus to a mosaic defect pattern even in the severely affected liver. A variable defect pattern was found in liver, muscle and heart tissue as revealed by biochemical, cytochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization analysis. Functionally, a severe deficiency of cytochrome-c-oxidase (cox) activity was seen in the liver. Although mtDNA depletion was detected in heart and skeletal muscle, there was no cox deficiency in these tissues. Depletion of mtDNA and microdissection of coxpositive or negative areas correlated with the histological pattern in the liver. Interestingly, the mosaic pattern detected for cox-activity and mtDNA copy number fully aligned with the immunohistologically revealed defect pattern using Pol 'Y, mtSSBand mtTFA-antibodies, thus substantiating the hypothesis that nuclear encoded proteins located within mitochondria become unstable and are degraded when they are not actively bound to mtDNA.

Postprandial lactate was normal. In contrast, hypoglycemia and hyperlactacidemia were induced by fasting periods of 8 h and did not respond to IM glucagon. LCT restriction induced a decreased of abdominal distension and jaundice, associated with biochemical improvement of hepatocellular cytolysis and cholestasis.

At the age of three years, her developmental quotient was 62 (Harvey test). A few months later she was admitted in status epilepticus with generalized tonico-clonic seizures. She had an intermittent tremor, moderate truncal ataxia with a wide-based gait.

{"text": "The catalytic subunit plays a critical role since it contains both polymerase and proofreading exonuclease activities (Longley et al., 2001). Mutations in POLG represent the most common causes of autosomally inherited mitochondrial diseases in children and adults (Wong et al., 2008). The ﬁrst mutation in POLG was discovered in 2001 in a Belgian family with Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (PEO) (Van Goethem et al., 2001). The phenotype of patients with POLG mutations is often heterogeneous and, as observed in other mitochondrial disorders, may lead to involvement of several organ systems. The reported POLG mutations are inherited either in an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner (DiMauro et al., 2006; Horvath et al., 2006). Diagnosis in a clinical setting may pose a challenge to clinicians and molecular testing including sequencing of POLG in suspected cases can help to reach a diagnosis and institute proper counseling. In this report we present an adult patient with a complicated medical history where multiple evaluations had failed to arrive at a diagnosis until a novel POLG mutation, brieﬂy described in an earlier paper by Tang et al.

Because the clinical picture can be quite miscellaneous, it is challenging to assort patients to any of the currently described syndromes; therefore, to provide such a patient with a conclusive diagnosis can be challenging for the neurologist. A typical magnetic resonance imaging finding is probably the most useful landmark in the diagnostic process, which will steer the clinician toward POLG gene testing. To illustrate this, we present a case of progressive ataxia caused by A467T and W748S mutations of POLG gene, who presented with overlapping symptoms of autosomal recessive mitochondrial ataxic syndrome and SANDO, as well as choreoathetotic movements and dysphonia.

Our provisional diagnosis was cervical dystonia with either jerky tremor or myoclonic jerks, and we suspected some aggravation, particularly in her gait disturbance, related to psychosocial factors. Mutation analysis for the SGCE gene was negative and brain imaging was normal. She was given clonazepam in combination with botulinum toxin injections, which had a moderate effect. Her head tremor and gait difficulty continued to progress and she gradually developed jerks of her left arm and sensory disturbances in both arms. She was admitted at age 45 years because of a generalized tonic– clonic seizure. During admission, several short-lasting— possibly epileptic—myoclonic jerks were observed alternatingly in the left and right arm.

Prognosis of mitochondrial epilepsy is often poor and there are few reports of successful treatment of POLG-related epilepsy. We describe a 26-year-old woman who experienced severe headache during a three-day period, followed by symptoms of visual ﬂashing, speech difﬁculty, and generalised seizures. EEG recording showed non-convulsive status epilepticus (left occipital area) and brain MRI revealed parieto-occipital T2-hyperintensities. Visual aura and aphasia persisted despite antiepileptic medication with phenytoin, oxcarbazepine, and levetiracetam. Mitochondrial disorder was clinically suspected and a homozygous c.2243G>C mutation (p.Trp748Ser) was discovered in the POLG1 gene. The patient was then set on a low glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) variant of the ketogenic diet, after which the headaches, aphasia, and visual aura progressively improved and disappeared. She returned home two weeks after onset of symptoms and has not had further seizures. She continues to receive levetiracetam monotherapy and LGIT.

Acute phase NIHSS score was 4. Fatigability and myotonic phenomena were absent. Acute phase cerebral CT scan was negative for acute ischemic lesions.

More than 150 different point mutations in the gene have been reported to be disease causing, resulting in a large range of clinical symptoms.

{"text": "The proband of family 1 (Figure 1a) was a 54-year-old woman of German ancestry. She reported a progressive balance disturbance since age 49 on the background of having had trouble walking heel-to-toe and hopping for many years. Her neurologic exam showed reduced vibration sensation (Rydell-Seiffer tuning fork 0–1 at the toes, 3–4 at the ankles and knees) and pinprick sensation (reduced to the mid-calves). Deep tendon reflexes, as well as strength, bulk and tone were normal. Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements and rapid alternating movements were normal. A MRI of the brain at age 52 was normal. At age 57, neuro-ophthalmic evaluation revealed a mild supranuclear vertical gaze paresis and a mild right internuclear ophthalmoparesis (slowed right adducting saccades with dissociated abducting nystagmus) localizing to the rostral midbrain (Liu, et al.). There was no gazeevoked nystagmus, saccadic dysmetria, or abnormal lack of suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex, and her optic nerves were normal in appearance. Nerve conductions of the left arm (Table 1) revealed mildly reduced sensory amplitudes and normal to reduced motor responses in the feet; electromyography of the left leg showed moderate, chronic denervation in distal muscles. When last seen at age 58, her balance had worsened. At age 79 and 85, her mother and father were evaluated, respectively. Both parents had had surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis. The mother had normal strength in the arms and legs; electrophysiology of the left arm showed no evidence of a neuropathy. The father had no movement in ankle dorsior plantar-flexion; strength in the arms was normal, and EMG of his left arm showed only mild, chronic denervation in his intrinsic hand muscles. For this reason, neuropathy alone is unlikely to be cause of the severe denervation in the legs.

Cell toxicity, without direct effect on mitochondrial respiratory function, was detected at different antibiotic concentrations. The clinical outcome, together with the different in vitro sensitivity to ceftriaxone among patient and control cells, suggested that the mitochondrial disease symptoms were hastened by the infection and were possibly worsened by the pharmacological treatment.
